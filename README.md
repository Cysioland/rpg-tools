## Usage

### duration_rand.rb
This is a tool, that allows you to randomly generate, when will an action happen. It takes two parameters, all in format like `1h10m30s`:
* **minimum** — at least this amount of time needs to pass
* **maximum** — at most this amount of time can pass

### dice.rb
This is a tool, that allows you to randomly throw die. By default it's a 1d6.
* **dice type** — in the classic <amount>d<faces> format, ie. 3d6, 2d10.
